I am presently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University, under the guidance of Dr. Roger H. French. My research is centered around the FAIRification of data. I am enthusiastic about embracing new challenges that stimulate creative problem-solving.

Outside of my academic endeavors, I delve into independent music production, seamlessly blending my technical skills with artistic expression. This fusion enables me to explore diverse interests and contribute meaningfully to both the academic and creative spheres.
